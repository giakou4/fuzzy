# Fuzzy

## Satellite no.16
Design of a conventional and a fuzzy PI controller to control the orientation 
angle of a satellite (assignment 16) with MATLAB 2019a. In the
first part of the assignment we design a conventional linear PI controller
for the given plant system. For more information see Automatic Control
Systems. In the second part, we design a Fuzzy PI cntroller and regulate
it with the results from the 1rst part. The FZ-PI is tested for a number
of given inputs and observe the ability to match the input signal.

## Car G
The purpose of this assignment is to design a fuzzy controller in order
to avoid obstacles. The vehcile should drive itself safely to the desired
position (xd; yd). Special sensors provide information about the distances
from the obstacles in horizontal (dH) and vertical position (dV ). The
vehicle's velocity is constant and equal to u = 0:05 m/sec. Given the
vertical and horizontal distances from the obstacles and the angle of the
velocity υ, the FLC should decide about the change of the angle θ so
as for the car to move to the desired position. Script written in MATLAB
2019a.

## Regression
The aim of this assignment is to investigate the ability of TSK models
to model multivariate, nonlinear functions. Specifically, two datasets are
selected from the UCI repository in order to estimate the variable target
from the available data, using fuzzy neural models. The first dataset will
be used for a simple investigation of the training and evaluation process
of such models, as well as a demonstration of ways of analyzing and in-
terpreting the results. The second, more complex dataset will be used
for a more complete modeling process, which will include, among other
things, preprocessing steps such as feature selection, as well as methods
for optimizing models through cross validation.

## Classification
The aim of this assignment is to investigate the ability of TSK models
in solving classification problems. Specifically, two datasets are selected
from the UCI repository for classification in their respective classes, us-
ing fuzzy neural models. The work consists of two parts, the first of
which is intended for a simple investigation of the training and evalua-
tion process of TSK models, while the second includes a more systematic
approach to the problem of data learning, combined with preprocessing
steps such as feature selection and model optimization methods through
cross-validation.
